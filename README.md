# My-Learning
here I am putting the roadmap of what I need to do to become better software engineer. As my primary language is Golang it will be more focused on it. As well as I will be adding more topics or technology which can help me sharpen my skills.

## Let's start
- [ ] Golang Interface (Design Patterns)
- [ ] Goroutines
- [ ] gRPC
- [ ] WebSocket
- [ ] Event-Driven
